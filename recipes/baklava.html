            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Baklava is a delicious Turkish dessert with an amazing aroma. It is traditionally made by layering thin sheets of buttered filo pastry on top of each other and sandwiching crushed pistachios between them. After baking, it is sweetened with a syrup of sugar, water and lemon juice. 
                <br>A good baklava should have a beautiful golden colour and crunchy texture. Other types of nut, like walnuts or hazelnuts, may be used instead of pistachios. My favourite is fıstıklı baklava (pistachio baklava) but homemade cevizli baklava (walnut baklava) has its own unique taste. Afiyet olsun! :)

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place walnuts, pistachios, and cinnamon in bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until mixture is chopped but not too fine.</li>
                    <li>Brush bottom of 9-inch round baking pan with melted butter. Place one round of phyllo dough in the pan; add a second round of dough. Drip about 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top. Add 2 more sheets and drizzle with butter. Add 2 more sheets and drip with butter creating 6 layers for the bottom. (While you work keep the phyllo sheets covered with a damp, nearly dry, cotton towel to keep dough from drying out.)</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with 1/3 of the nut mixture. Top with a sheet of phyllo and drip with melted butter; repeat with 1 more sheet of filo. Add another 1/3 of the nut mixture.</li>
                    <li>Place another sheet of phyllo on the nuts; drip with butter. Top with another sheet and drip with butter. Add the remaining nut mixture.</li>
                    <li>Top with 2 sheets of phyllo; drip with butter. Add 2 more sheets; drip with butter. Top with the last 2 sheets and drizzle generously with the remaining butter. Cover pan with plastic and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Cut baklava into about 12 diamond-shaped pieces approximately the same size.</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven until browned and crisp, about an hour.</li>
                    <li>Place sugar, honey, and cloves in a saucepan. Pour in water. Place pan over medium-high heat and whisk to combine. Bring to a boil; remove from heat. Whisk in vanilla and orange blossom water.</li>
                    <li>After baklava has rested 5 minutes, ladle syrup over the top. Cool down to room temperature before serving.</li>
                </ol>
