## The Odin Project 

### The project: Recipes

The purpose of this project is to create a basic recipe website to practice HTML and CSS.
I'll update this project in the future to style it up with CSS and make it responsive.

#### Resources 
Recipes and Images by [Chef John](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/foodwisheswithchefjohn/) from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)

#### The steps I followed for the recipe website:

-Initial structure
    - Created `odin-recipes` directory and added index page within it
    -  Filled it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and added an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body
- Recipe Page 
    - Created a new directory named `recipes` within `odin-recipes` directory
    - Created new HTML files within `recipes` directory and named them after the recipes they will contain. 
    - Added h1 headings with the names of the recipes ​as theirs contents
    - Linked the new recipe pages to the index page and put all the links in an unordered list
- Recipe Page Content
    - Added images under the h1 heading tag on the recipe pages.
    - Added “Description” heading followed by describing the recipe 
    - Added an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe 
    - Added a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish
    - Added recipe preparation info with icons to the top of the ingredients
    - Added Chef's notes under the steps 
    - Added homepage and next recipe buttons at the bottom of recipe pages
